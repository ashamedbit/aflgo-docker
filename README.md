# AFLGo libxml2 Example

## General

This sets up a Docker environment to build AFLGo and run the bug injected versions of libxml2, zstd and PROJ examples.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashamedbit/aflgo-docker.git
cd aflgo-docker
docker build -t aflgo . 
```

Just execute `./run.sh` to get going. Note that if you build everything for the first time it will take quite long â˜•
If you want to fuzz another project with AFLGo and this setup just modify the `./setup_afl_and_fuzz.sh` file below the `project specific steps` comment.

## Docker Base Image

Currently the Docker base image is `ubuntu:20.04`.
`ubuntu:22.04` and `ubuntu:23.04` did *not* work out-of-the-box (compilation of LLVM 11 failed)
